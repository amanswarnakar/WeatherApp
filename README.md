# WeatherApp
In this Weather App we can input the city name and submit the query and then the current weather of the city is displayed (Temperature, Min Temp, Max Temp, Humidity, Weather Description and a Weather Icon). The background image also changes based on the weather description. I have used openweathermap.org API for the weather data.
